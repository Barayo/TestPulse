## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Run creation pins case versions
The system SHALL let users create a test run from a suite and/or an explicit list of cases. Each run item MUST pin the case version that is current at the moment the item is added to the run, and that pin SHALL never change afterwards. A run item MAY carry an optional `testName` — the literal name reported by an external test runner, independent of the pinned case's own title.

#### Scenario: Run pins versions at creation
- **WHEN** a run is created containing a case whose current version is 2, and the case is later edited to version 3
- **THEN** the run item still references version 2 and displays version 2's content

#### Scenario: Case added to an open run pins the then-current version
- **WHEN** a case is added to an already-created run after the case reached version 3
- **THEN** that run item pins version 3

#### Scenario: A run item's testName is independent of the case's title
- **WHEN** a run item carries a `testName` that differs from its pinned case's title
- **THEN** both are shown — the case's own title is not overwritten or replaced by the reported name

### Requirement: Append-only result log
Each run item SHALL have an append-only result log. A result records actor, verdict (`pass`, `failed`, `skipped`, `blocked`), optional comment, and timestamp. Results MUST NOT be editable or deletable through the API. A result MAY additionally carry optional execution metadata: start time, end time, platform, version, and tags.

#### Scenario: Results accumulate
- **WHEN** an item receives verdict `failed`, is marked retest, and then receives verdict `pass`
- **THEN** the result log lists both results in order and the item's current status is `pass`

#### Scenario: Actor is required
- **WHEN** a result is submitted without an actor
- **THEN** the request is rejected with a validation error naming the field

#### Scenario: Execution metadata is optional
- **WHEN** a result is recorded without start time, end time, platform, version, or tags
- **THEN** the result is recorded normally, with those fields absent

#### Scenario: A manually-recorded result can also carry execution metadata
- **WHEN** a user records a verdict through the UI and supplies a platform or version
- **THEN** the result reflects it, the same as a result produced by an import
