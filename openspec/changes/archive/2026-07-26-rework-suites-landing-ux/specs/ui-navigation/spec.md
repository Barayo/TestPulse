## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Suites list stays clean; membership managed in its own drawer
The suites index SHALL show each suite as a card with its name, a pass-rate health
bar (or a "Never run" state when it has no runs yet), its case count, and its last-run
time. Selecting a suite SHALL navigate to a dedicated route
(`/projects/{projectKey}/suites/{suiteKey}`) rather than opening an inline dialog,
matching the full-entity-page pattern already used for cases and run items:
breadcrumbs, a filterable case list as the primary content, and a properties sidebar
(case count, pass rate, last run, created date, and rename/delete actions).
Creating a suite SHALL navigate directly into its new (empty) detail page rather than
opening a combined name-and-case-selection form on the index.

#### Scenario: Suite index card shows health at a glance
- **WHEN** a user views the suites index and a suite has at least one closed run
- **THEN** its card shows a pass-rate health bar in the healthy/in-progress/at-risk band matching its rate

#### Scenario: Never-run suite shows a distinct state
- **WHEN** a suite has never had a run created from it
- **THEN** its card shows "Never run" rather than a 0% pass rate

#### Scenario: Selecting a suite navigates to its own page
- **WHEN** a user selects a suite from the index
- **THEN** the browser URL changes to that suite's detail route, and the browser back button returns to the index

#### Scenario: Suite detail page shows filterable case membership
- **WHEN** a user opens a suite's detail page
- **THEN** its member cases are shown in a checkbox list filterable by tag, priority, platform, and test type, with selection preserved across filter changes

#### Scenario: Creating a suite opens straight into its detail page
- **WHEN** a user creates a new suite from the index
- **THEN** the app navigates to that suite's (empty) detail page instead of showing a case-selection form on the index

#### Scenario: Renaming a suite
- **WHEN** a user renames a suite from its detail page
- **THEN** the suite's name updates everywhere it is shown, including the index

#### Scenario: Deleting a suite preserves its cases
- **WHEN** a user deletes a suite from its detail page
- **THEN** the suite no longer appears on the index, and its former member cases are untouched in the Library
